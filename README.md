# ðŸ«‚ Members Only

**Members Only** is an exclusive web application where members can anonymously write and share posts. This project allows members to create posts, view others' posts, and discover who authored each post within the club. 
Outside the club, users can see only the content of the posts and not the identities behind them, keeping the stories anonymous to non-members.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, sign in, and sign out with Devise, a powerful authentication system for Rails.
- **Post Creation**: Signed-in members can create posts that are only visible to other signed-in members.
- **Anonymous Viewing**: Non-members can view the posts but cannot see who authored them.
- **Membership Exclusivity**: Only registered users can see the author of posts, ensuring a sense of exclusivity for club members.
- **Flash Notifications**: Users receive notifications about successful actions like signing up, logging in, or creating posts.

## Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails**: The backend framework used to build the application.
- **Devise**: For authentication and user management.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database to store user and post data.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend development and styling.
